# Data-Structures-Project-Linked-List-Stack-and-Queue-Menu-Driven-
This project is a console-based implementation of three fundamental data structures- Linked List, Stack, and Queue—designed to demonstrate core concepts of object-oriented programming and dynamic memory management.

The application provides an interactive, menu-driven user interface that allows users to perform common operations on each data structure such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit, making it ideal for educational purposes and practice with data structure algorithms.


🚀 Features
🔗 Linked List

Node-based implementation where each node stores:

Generic object data (e.g., Student, Teacher, etc.)

Reference to the next node

Operations supported:

Insert at the beginning

Insert at the end

Insert at a specific position

Delete from the beginning

Delete from the end

Delete from a specific position

Search for an element

Display all nodes

📚 Stack

Implements LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior

Operations supported:

Push (add element to top)

Pop (remove top element)

Peek/Top (view top element)

Get stack size

Check if stack is empty

🚶 Queue

Implements FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior

Operations supported:

Enqueue (add element to rear)

Dequeue (remove front element)

Peek/Front (view front element)

Get queue size

Check if queue is empty

🎯 Purpose

This project was created for academic learning and demonstration purposes. It helps students understand:

How linked structures work internally

Stack and queue mechanics

Object-oriented design

Menu-driven program flow

Data structure manipulation in real time


🛠️ Technologies Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Console-based input/output

java
